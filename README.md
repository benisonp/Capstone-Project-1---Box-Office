# Capstone Project 1 - Predicting the return on investment for movie production

## Premise

In this capstone project for Springboard's Data Science Career Track course, I look at Hollywood movies and their domestic 
box office, to understand how movie studios may better enhance their financial returns on investment. This repository contains
the code for the project (including scraping code), the data, slide deck, as well as the overall writeup for the project (which I highly
recommend reading for a more detailed analysis of the results.

## Essential Takeaways

Based on the models, it appears that Hollywood may be currently overindexing on movies in the drama genre, when the emphasis
should be on horror movies, which have a pattern of grossing more than their budget in the box office, a good early indicator
that they tend to be profitable. For more detailed insights, please take a look at the overall report.
